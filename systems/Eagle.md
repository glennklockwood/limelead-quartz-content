Eagle is the name of part of a cluster at Microsoft that ran [[HPL]] and debuted at #3 on the Top500 listings for November 2023.[^1] According to Mark Russinovich, it is a "tiny fraction" of a much larger supercomputer.[^2] See [[Azure supercomputers]] for more.

The Eagle run used 14,400 [[H100]] GPUs (1,800 [[Azure ND H100 v5]] nodes) interconnected with [[InfiniBand]] to achieve 561,200 TFlop/s with $N_{\text{max}} =11,796,480$. This means the HPL run took 1,950 seconds.[^3]

An Eagle node was publicly displayed at SC23 and photos were posted by ServeTheHome.[^sth]
