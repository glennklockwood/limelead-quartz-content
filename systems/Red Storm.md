Red Storm was a supercomputer developed by Cray and Sandia that became the basis for the Cray XT3 platform. [After the Storm: The supercomputer that saved Cray - DCD (datacenterdynamics.com)](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/analysis/after-the-storm-the-supercomputer-that-saved-cray/) is a great article that describes its history and significance. A detailed technical description, including cost and architecture, is provided in [Cray XT3 and Cray XT Series of Supercomputers](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-0-387-09766-4_305).

Here's a photo of a Red Storm cabinet:[^1]

Of note, this predates Cray's fancy rack graphics, and it has "RS" branding rather than the "XT3" branding that appeared later on these cabinets.

Red Storm also debuted Cray's SeaStar router. Here's what it looked like:[^1]
