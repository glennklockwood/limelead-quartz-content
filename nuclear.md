[[sustainability in HPC|Nuclear power]] is becoming a critical aspect of meeting large hyperscale and AI companies' commitments to become carbon-neutral or carbon-negative.

## SMRs

Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are being actively explored as power sources for individual data center campuses, but it isn't clear to me how long it will be before they can actually be built.

Larry Ellison has claimed that Oracle "secured building permits" for three SMRs to power a 1 GW data center complex.[^1]

[[NuScale]] received approval on its SMR design in January 2023.[^nuscale]

## Traditional reactors

As far as I know, there is only one new nuclear reactor being built in the US: [[TerraPower]]'s Natrium plant in Kemmerer, Wyoming[^terrapower] at the site of an old coal-fired plant.

There are a handful of reactors that have been recently decommissioned that are being brought back to life to support increased energy demands of AI.

- [[Palisades]] (Michigan) is an 805 MW reactor being restarted by Holtec International. US DOE offered a $1.5 billion loan, and the state of Michigan is offering $300 million.
- [[Three Mile Island]] (Pennsylvania) is an 837 MW reactor being restarted by Constellation and is bankrolled by Constellation ($1.6 billion) after Microsoft committed to pay for all its energy for twenty years.
- [[Duane Arnold]] (Iowa) is a 601 MW reactor that is under decommissioning. It has not yet been restarted, but it is one of few reactors that has not passed the point of no return in the decommissioning process.[^duane]
