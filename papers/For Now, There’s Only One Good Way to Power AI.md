[For Now, There’s Only One Good Way to Power AI](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/09/ai-microsoft-nuclear-three-mile-island/679988) was written soon after Microsoft and Constellation announced their partnership to restart [[Three Mile Island]].

Microsoft has committed to buy the power coming out of the plant and resell it to local markets to offset the power it uses in its own data centers (which can be anywhere in the country or world) which may rely on carbon-emitting power production. This effectively allows the utility company (Constellation) to not have to worry about losing money for selling expensive nuclear power instead of cheap gas-fired power, because Microsoft is effectively paying others to use carbon-free nuclear when they would have otherwise not.
