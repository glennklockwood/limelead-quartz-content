These are some thoughts I've had about responding to [Notice of Request for Information (RFI) on Frontiers in AI for Science, Security, and Technology (FASST) Initiative](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2024-09-12/pdf/2024-20676.pdf):

“Foundation models” are being used disingenuously to justify capex. Realize that foundation models for science are different than foundation models for language. Question whether a science-specific foundation model is truly worthwhile given practitioner comment at SMC and the BloombergGPT example.

Define “American leadership in AI compute” very precisely.

DOE needs to keep pace with the AI industry which does not limit itself with months-long FOAs preceding work. It also does not limit itself to judging progress based on traditional peer review in conferences and journals; consider how many foundational AI papers were only published on arxiv.

> This RFI seeks public input to inform  how DOE can partner with outside  institutions and leverage its assets to  implement and develop the roadmap for  FASST, based on the four pillars of  FASST: AI-ready data; Frontier-Scale AI  Computing Infrastructure and Platforms;  Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy AI  Models and Systems; and AI  Applications; as well as considerations  for workforce and FASST governance.

Energy efficiency is a red herring when the true concern is carbon emissions up to scope 3. Do not focus solely on energy efficiency, because that is a geographically constrained subset of the true problem.
