The accompanying plot is staggering because it visualizes the following:

> Companies such as Patch, CUR8 and CarbonX are working as a kind of market maker, linking corporate buyers with carbon project developers[^f7a6724e-6992-41aa-bbef-c230299c45ed]

> Removal credits, for projects that pull carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, are seen as higher quality than credits for projects that simply reduce emissions by preventing their release, known as avoidance credits. Because of that, they are also much more expensive. While an avoidance credit for a project promoting, say, smokeless stoves can cost less than $20 a ton, a removal credit for the latest direct-air capture technology can cost as much as $1,100 a ton, according to BloombergNEF. [^f7a6724e-6992-41aa-bbef-c230299c45ed]

So a **carbon removal credit** is worth 55$\times$ more than a **carbon avoidance credit**.
