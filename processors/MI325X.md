MI325X is an AMD GPU built on [[CDNA|CDNA 3]] that was launched on October 10, 2024 and will be in production in 4Q2024.[^launchtweet]

## Specifications

Each MI325X GPU has:

- ? XCDs
	- ? CUs (? per [[GPU terminology decoder ring|XCD]])
		- ? Stream Processors (? per [[GPU terminology decoder ring|CU]])
		- ? [[tensor cores|Matrix Cores]] (? per [[GPU terminology decoder ring|CU]])
	- ? GHz (peak)
	- ?? [[structured sparsity]]
- 256 GB HBM3e (? stacks)[^launchtweet]
	- 6 TB/s (max)
- ? AMD Infinity Fabric (D2D)
- ? PCIe Gen5 (H2D)
- ? W maximum

Given that its performance appears identical to [[MI300X]][^launchtweet], the above is probably the same architecture.

## Performance

The launch advertised 1.3 PF of FP16 and 2.6 PF of FP8.[^launchtweet] This appears to be the same as [[MI300X]].

The following are theoretical maximum performance in TFLOPS:

| Data Type | VFMA | Matrix | Sparse |
| --------- | ---- | ------ | ------ |
| FP64      |      |        |        |
| FP32      |      |        |        |
| TF32      |      |        |        |
| FP16      |      |        |        |
| BF16      |      |        |        |
| FP8       |      |        |        |
| INT32     |      |        |        |
| INT8      |      |        |        |
