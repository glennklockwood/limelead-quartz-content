title: AMD MI325X
---
MI325X is an AMD GPU built on [[CDNA|CDNA 3]] that was launched on October 10, 2024 and will be in production in 4Q2024.[^launchtweet]

It is positioned to compete against [[H200]] and, just as H200 was a memory bump to H100, MI325X is a memory bump to MI300X. However, MI325X also has a 1000 W maximum power, whereas MI300X was 750 W maximum.

## Specifications

Each MI325X GPU has:[^amdspecweb]

- 8 XCDs
	- 304 CUs (? per [[GPU terminology decoder ring|XCD]])
		- 19,456 Stream Processors (64 per [[GPU terminology decoder ring|CU]])
		- 1,216 [[tensor cores|Matrix Cores]] (4 per [[GPU terminology decoder ring|CU]])
	- 2.1 GHz (peak)
	- 2:4 [[structured sparsity]]
- 256 GB HBM3E (8 stacks?)[^launchtweet]
	- 6 TB/s (max)
- 7 AMD Infinity Fabric (D2D)[^3]
- 1 PCIe Gen5 (H2D)[^3]
- 1000 W maximum ([[TBP]])

Its compute subsystem (XCDs and below) appear identical to [[MI300X]], but its memory subsystem is upgraded to HBM3E. It is also specified at 1000 W TBP instead of 750 W.

## Performance

The launch advertised 1.3 PF of FP16 and 2.6 PF of FP8.[^launchtweet] This appears to be the same as [[MI300X]].

The following are theoretical maximum performance in TFLOPS:[^amdspecweb]

| Data Type | VFMA  | Matrix | Sparse |
| --------- | ----- | ------ | ------ |
| FP64      | 81.7  | 163.4  |        |
| FP32      | 164.4 | 163.4  |        |
| TF32      |       | 653.7  | 1307.4 |
| FP16      |       | 1307.4 | 2614.9 |
| BF16      |       | 1307.4 | 2614.9 |
| FP8       |       | 2614.9 | 5229.8 |
| INT32     |       |        |        |
| INT8      |       | 2614.9 | 5229.8 |

[^3]: The AMD spec page says there are 8 Infinity Fabric links and the GPU supports PCIe Gen5, but it doesn't specify how those are related. However, the [[MI300X]] spec says there are 7x16 Infinity Fabric links and 1x16 PCIe Gen5, so I assume MI325X is the same.
