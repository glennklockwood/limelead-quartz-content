MI250X is AMD's high-end [[CDNA|CDNA 2]] GPU.

## Specifications

Each MI250X GPU is actually two Graphics Compute Die (GCDs) connected with Infinity Fabric on a single [[OAM]] package, so a single GPU appears as two separate GPUs to the operating system and programmer. To be explicit, the following describes a single MI250X package:[^1]

- 2 GCDs (Graphics Compute Die)
	- 220 CUs (110 per [[GPU terminology decoder ring|GCD]])
		- 14,080 Stream Processors (64 per [[GPU terminology decoder ring|CU]])
		- 880 [[tensor cores|Matrix Cores]] (4 per [[GPU terminology decoder ring|CU]])
	- 1.7 GHz (peak)
	- No sparsity
- 128 GB HBM2e (8 stacks)
	- 3.2 TB/s (max)
- 8x AMD Infinity Fabric (D2D)
- 1x16 PCIe Gen4 (H2D)
- 560 W maximum

## Performance

The following are theoretical maximum performance in TFLOPS:[^1]

| Data Type | VFMA | Matrix | Sparse |
| --------- | ---- | ------ | ------ |
| FP64      | 47.9 | 95.7   |        |
| FP32      | 47.9 | 95.7   |        |
| TF32      |      |        |        |
| FP16      |      | 383    |        |
| BF16      |      | 383    |        |
| FP8       |      |        |        |
| INT32     |      |        |        |
| INT8      |      | 383    |        |
| INT4      |      | 383    |        |
