H200 is NVIDIA's HBM upgrade to [[H100]].[^1] It competes against [[MI325X]].

## Specifications

H200 GPUs are the same as H100 GPUs (SXM5 or GH variant?), just with 144 GB of HBM3e (more and faster HBM). And maybe more power? Not sure.

## Performance

Not sure. I'm not sure how many SMs are included as standard for H200.

## Form factors

H200 is sold on an 8-way HGX baseboard just like [[H100]] (NVL8), on a [[GH200]] superchip, or integrated into a DGX [[GH200]] pod (NVL32).[^2]
