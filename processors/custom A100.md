NVIDIA seems to have sold a bunch of [[A100]] variants to European HPC centers that use non-standard quantities of HBM:

- [[Alps]] has 96 GB of HBM2e instead of the standard 80 GB HBM2e in second-gen A100 GPUs
- [[Leonardo]] has 64 GB of HBM2 instead of the standard 40 GB of HBM2 in first-gen A100 GPUs
