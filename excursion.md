In the context of failure and [[reliability]], _excursions_ are physical defects in semiconductors (CPUs, GPUs, memory) that can accelerate the failure of a component.

Excursions can cause circuits to rapidly burn through, short, or otherwise fail over time. This is insidious because the part may function fine after manufacturing and pass many screens.
