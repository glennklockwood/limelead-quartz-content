This page is a central point for topics related to reducing the carbon footprint of large-scale HPC and AI infrastructure.

## Scale

- "One gigawatt is enough energy to power about 750,000 homes."[^wsj2]
- "Vantage has started to see deals with tenants in the 100- to 500-megawatt range “that are specifically in support of AI on a dedicated basis for customers,” he said."[^wsj3]

## Locations

- "Major data-center markets include Northern Virginia, Atlanta, Phoenix and Silicon Valley. But increasingly, development is spreading to secondary markets, including northern Indiana, Idaho, Arkansas and Kansas, according to CBRE."[^wsj2]
- "there are still many places, including a swath from Pennsylvania to Illinois, with an oversupply of power."[^wsj1]

## Players

- Silver Lake, Vantage, DigitalBridge[^wsj3]

## Nuclear

[[nuclear|Nuclear power]] is a zero-carbon source of energy that provides the base load power required by large AI data centers.
