# Distributed Asynchronous Object Storage

DAOS is a high-performance, all-NVMe parallel storage system developed over the course of over a decade by the HDF Group, Whamcloud, and Intel. It shares a common lineage with many of the original creators of [[Lustre]], but it was designed from the ground up to not adhere to POSIX semantics and instead offer a native object interface.

It is the storage system for [[Aurora]].
