In HPC, there are two ways to look at the reliability of a supercomputer.

**Top-down** reliability is where you start with what a full-scale system job would experience in practice and begin breaking that down. Top-down reliability is governed by metrics that characterize [[job reliability]].

**Bottoms-up** reliability is where you start with individual components and build a reliability model by connecting those components in series and in parallel. Bottoms-up reliability is governed by metrics that characterize [[component reliability]].
