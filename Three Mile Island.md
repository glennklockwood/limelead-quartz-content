Three Mile Island is a [[nuclear power]] station in Pennsylvania. In September 2024, its owner, [Constellation, announced that it signed an agreement with Microsoft](https://www.constellationenergy.com/newsroom/2024/Constellation-to-Launch-Crane-Clean-Energy-Center-Restoring-Jobs-and-Carbon-Free-Power-to-The-Grid.html) whereby:

- [[Constellation]] would refurbish and bring online the 837 MW TMI-1 reactor at a cost of $1.6 billion by 2028.[^cnbc] The reactor was taken offline in 2019 due to adverse economic conditions.
- The reactor will operate until at least 2054
- [[Microsoft]] has agreed to a twenty-year _power purchase agreement_.

[[Microsoft]]'s official announcement about this is here: [Accelerating the addition of carbon-free energy: An update on progress](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-cloud/blog/2024/09/20/accelerating-the-addition-of-carbon-free-energy-an-update-on-progress/).

A layperson's description of this _power purchase agreement_ is described in [For Now, There’s Only One Good Way to Power AI - The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/09/ai-microsoft-nuclear-three-mile-island/679988/):

Microsoft has committed to buy the power coming out of the plant and resell it to local markets to offset the power it uses in its own data centers (which can be anywhere in the country or world) which may rely on carbon-emitting power production. This effectively allows the utility company (Constellation) to not have to worry about losing money for selling expensive nuclear power instead of cheap gas-fired power, because Microsoft is effectively paying others to use carbon-free nuclear when they would have otherwise not.
