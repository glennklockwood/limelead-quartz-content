LCCF is the NSF Leadership Class Computing Facility.[^3] It will launch in 2026 and be the vehicle for deploying [[Horizon]]. I think it is a virtual organization with a charge to promote data storage, software and services, education, and federate resources. It is also presumed to play a significant role in [[NAIRR]].
