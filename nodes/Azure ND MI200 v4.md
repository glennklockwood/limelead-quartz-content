ND MI200 v4 is Azure's eight-way [[MI250X]] VM type and compute node. I don't think it was ever made available to the public, but Microsoft's [Explorer](https://top500.org/system/180171/) supercomputer was built using this node and debuted at #11 in the [June 2023 Top500 list](https://top500.org/lists/top500/2023/06/).

The physical node looks like this:[^1]
