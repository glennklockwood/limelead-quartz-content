The National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource (NAIRR) is an effort to democratize AI for research.[^miller] It will do this by establishing a national infrastructure that provides researchers the data, software, models, and training to participate in AI research.[^nsf] It was preceded by a report written by the NAIRR Task Force and established by the Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence in October 2023.[^wh]

NSF was tasked with taking the lead on NAIRR, but there are 13 federal agencies and 26 non-governmental partners involved.[^nsf]

## Pilot

The [NAIRR Pilot](https://www.nairrpilot.org/) began in January 2024, will run for two years, and is a prerequisite to establishing the "full-scale NAIRR."[^wh] It is currently implemented as a portal that federates access to donated resources based on awarded allocations.

The federal NAIRR pilot members include:[^nsf]

1. NSF
2. DARPA
3. DOD
4. Department of Education
5. DOE
6. Veterans Affairs
7. NASA
8. NIH
9. NIST
10. NOAA
11. Department of Agriculture
12. USGS
13. USPTO

The "non-governmental partners" are:[^wh]

1. Allen Institute
2. AWS
3. Anthropic - providing API access to its closed models[^ascac2409]
4. AMD
5. Cerebras
6. Databricks
7. Datavant (what's this?)
8. EleutherAI - nonprofit with experience training LLMs[^ascac2409]
9. Google
10. Groq - allows researchers to bring their own models for inferencing[^ascac2409]
11. HPE
12. Huggingface
13. IBM
14. Intel
15. [[Meta]]
16. [[Microsoft]]
17. MLCommons
18. NVIDIA
19. Omidyar Network (what's this?)
20. OpenAI - providing API access to its closed models[^ascac2409]
21. OpenMined - focus on privacy-preserving models[^ascac2409]
22. Palantir
23. Regenstrief Institute
24. SambaNova
25. Vocareum (what's this?)
26. Weights & Biases

## Full-scale

The specific scope of the full-scale NAIRR is being established by the CREATE AI Act[^1] which has bipartisan support as of September 2024. It is anticipated to be a multi-billion dollar program with funds to build cyberinfrastructure which participating agencies will receive.[^miller]
