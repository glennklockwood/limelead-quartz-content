Palisades is an 805 MW [[nuclear]] reactor in Covert Township on Lake Michigan being restarted by Holtec International.

The [[DOE]] is providing a $1.5 billion loan to Holtec,[^1] and the state of Michigan offered $300 million. As of September 2024, all funding has been secured to restart the reactor by the end of 2025 if NRC approvals are granted.[^1]

Per CNBC, it sounds like the energy from Palisades is committed via a PPA, but not for AI/data centers:
