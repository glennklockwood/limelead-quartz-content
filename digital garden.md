Although this site is a digital garden, I am not sure I think of it as such. Instead, it's my personal knowledge base. However, I maintain it for many of the same reasons people play with digital gardening.

Some great resources about digital gardening:

- [Jackie Zhao's digital garden entry on Networked Thought](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) describes how and why he maintains his digital garden, and his reasons are remarkably similar to mine.
- [Andy Matuschak's working notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/) contains some opinionated perspectives on how best to organize notes that helped me validate the way I've come to organize my notes and crystallize some concepts that I vaguely discovered myself.
- [A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) by Maggie Appleton offers a broad perspective on the social movement behind "digital gardening" and the different ways in which people have approached it. Also very validating to read someone put to words the reasons why I find maintaining this satisfying.
- [Digital gardens let you cultivate your own little bit of the internet](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/) by Tanya Basu in the MIT Technology Review also offers an accessible perspective and history on digital gardening.
