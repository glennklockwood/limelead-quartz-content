title: Neuromorphic computing
---
Neuromorphic computing was a hot topic when IBM released [TrueNorth](https://research.ibm.com/publications/truenorth-design-and-tool-flow-of-a-65-mw-1-million-neuron-programmable-neurosynaptic-chip) in 2015.

Exascale sucked all the air out of the room through the early 2020s, but neuromorphic appears to be resurfacing as a hot post-exascale topic.

DOE ran a series of requirements gatherings for post-Exascale in September 2024, and neuromorphic was the topic of one workshop.[^ascac]

Independently, Juelich has suggested that they are going to invest in neuromorphic after they deliver [[JUPITER]].[^smc24]

In a personal conversation with someone in neuromorphic in September 2024, I learned that there are analog and digital (CMOS) approaches to neuromorphic. TrueNorth is a digital implementation. I don't know if there has ever been a commercial analog implementation.

[^ascac]: Hal Finkel mentioned this at the ASCAC meeting on September 2024. Need to find the slides.
[^smc24]: This was mentioned by Hans-Christian from LRZ at Smoky Mountains Conference in September 2024.
