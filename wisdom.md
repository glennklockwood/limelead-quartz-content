There are some quotes and pearls of wisdom that I keep referring back to throughout life, so I'm sticking some of them here.

I'm no great fan of Maya Angelou, but this quote plastered on the wall of the Microsoft 555 San Francisco office crystallizes my approach to rhetoric.

>Any man who must say, "I am the king," is no true king.

I always think of this quote when I see peopled on LinkedIn who title themselves as "leaders" or "influencers." If you are really a leader in your field, why do you need to tell people that? Surely there's something more concrete that you can point to that demonstrates your leadership.
