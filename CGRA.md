CGRA refers to a type of processor that provides coarse-grained dataflow acceleration.

A few examples include[^matsuoka22]

- [Wave Computing's Dataflow Processor](https://www.wavecomp.ai/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/WP_CGRA.pdf)
- [Intel's Configurable Spatial Accelerator](https://www.nextplatform.com/2018/08/30/intels-exascale-dataflow-engine-drops-x86-and-von-neuman/)

They were really popular in 2018, but they have not attracted much attention outside of [[FugakuNEXT]] in recent times.
