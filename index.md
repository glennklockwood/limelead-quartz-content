This [[digital garden]] is an experiment in publishing some of the material I maintain in a private [[Obsidian]] vault as a supplement to [my personal website][].

I work as a [[system architect]] who helps design some of the largest supercomputers in the world. I spent seven years doing this in the the [[doe|U.S. Department of Energy]] complex, where I contributed to the design and evaluation of supercomputers including [[Perlmutter]], [[Frontier]], and [[El Capitan]]. I then joined Microsoft Azure where I now work on the design of supercomputers designed for [[LLM training]] such as [[Eagle]].

Most recently, I have been working on understanding and predicting the [[reliability]] of supercomputers for [[LLM training at scale]]. This means analyzing the failures that occur on production AI supercomputers that result in job interrupts, predicting the failure of future systems using component-level reliability and statistical modeling, and devising ways in which software and hardware improvements can increase the stability of long-running, full-system jobs.

From 2015 to 2023, I specialized in [storage](tags/storage) for HPC and actively participated in that community. I wrote a bunch of papers around file system performance analysis, reliability, utilization, and architectural philosophy. I also managed a team of storage engineers for a year and dabbled in the broader area of data management for scientific computing.
